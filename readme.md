# Smart Task Management System

A modern, robust, and scalable task management system built using **Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB**. This project strictly follows **SOLID principles**, implements the **Service-Repository Pattern**, and incorporates secure authentication practices.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **MongoDB Backend**: Fully integrated MongoDB database utilizing Mongoose for object modeling.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing.
- **SOLID Architecture**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separated routes, services, repositories, and models.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: Extended functionality via abstract classes like `BaseService` and `BaseRepository`.
  - **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces like `IRepository`, `ITaskService`) rather than concrete implementations.
- **Robust Testing**: Configured with Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Modern Next.js**: Built using the Next.js App Router for server-side rendering and API routes.

## 🧠 System Design & Patterns

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database operations away from business logic.
- **Service Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic, making it reusable across API endpoints.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used for Service and Repository instances to manage resources efficiently and ensure a single database connection through `dbConnect()`.

### Object-Oriented Principles (OOP)
- **Abstraction**: Base classes and interfaces hide database implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Strict type checking via interfaces (`ITask`, `IProject`).
- **Polymorphism**: Inherited services and repositories can override base methods as needed.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

- **MongoDB with Mongoose**
- Tasks reference Projects using a one-to-many relationship (`projectId` as `ObjectId`).
- Users and Tasks maintain a one-to-many relationship (`assignedTo`).
